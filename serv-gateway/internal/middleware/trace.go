// TraceID returns a middleware that assigns a trace ID to every request, at the very front
// of the chain (input), so it's available to every downstream layer (logging, proxy, response).
// If the caller already sent X-Trace-Id (e.g. propagated from another upstream gateway), that
// value is kept — otherwise a new UUID is generated. The trace ID is echoed back to the client
// on X-Trace-Id so it can be correlated with logs/support tickets, and it's what
// proxy.injectCallerHeaders forwards upstream on the same header (output to service).
